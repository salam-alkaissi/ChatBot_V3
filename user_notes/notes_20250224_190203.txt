Note saved at 19:01:
The term "baselines" in the context of a PDF can refer to two primary concepts, depending on the user's intent:

### 1. **Typographical Baselines**  
These are the invisible lines on which text characters rest. Extracting baseline data (e.g., coordinates for text alignment) requires parsing the PDF's internal structure.  
- **Tools/Methods**:  
  - Use libraries like `PyMuPDF` (Python) to extract text with positional metadata.  
  - Example code snippet:  
    ```python
    import fitz  # PyMuPDF
    doc = fitz.open("example.pdf")
    page = doc[0]
    blocks = page.get_text("dict")["blocks"]
    for block in blocks:
        for line in block["lines"]:
            baseline_coords = line["bbox"]  # Bounding box includes baseline info
            print(f"Baseline coordinates: {baseline_coords}")
    ```

### 2. **PDF Structure Baselines**  
This refers to the foundational components of a PDF file, such as:  
- **Objects**: The building blocks (text, images, fonts).  
- **Content Streams**: Instructions for rendering pages.  
- **Metadata**: Titles, authors, and creation dates.  
- **File Structure**: Header, body, cross-reference table, and trailer.  

### Key Notes:  
- Without access to the specific PDF, exact baselines cannot be determined.

Here’s how to map tasks to the simplest viable solution:

Translate English→French: Statistical (or neural for better quality).
Word meanings: Knowledge-based (e.g., WordNet).
Find person names: Statistical/Neural (e.g., NER models).
Phone numbers/emails: Rule-based regex (simplest!).
Split text into words: Rule-based tokenization.
Predict text language: Statistical (fast, lightweight).
Weather report→poem: LLM (creative generation).
Document classification: Statistical/Neural.
Answer any question: LLM (broad knowledge).
Tradeoffs with LLMs:
Pros: General-purpose, no task-specific tuning.
Cons: High cost, low explainability, environmental impact, dependency on third parties.
